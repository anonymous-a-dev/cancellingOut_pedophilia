# Note, the cost is to be calculate as a "minus" to the same kind of harm cancelled out - i.e. as a causality-factor in shaping the %-part of the occurrences manifesting, shaping a real "value eval"
    - Include the eval that'll occur anyway, but making in honest and catching it up ahead; minus to "within a particular frame like an environment" even if it is caused outside the given frame - but eval the loss as well outside (useful for such as threat-mitagation, to put it in those terms). 
    - Note; this is not to be vile, but to be realistic about the application of the system, and by meeting it face on lowering the "dishonesty" that the vileness be decreased
